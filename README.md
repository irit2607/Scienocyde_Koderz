<p>Idea: Science Fair management system (Scienocyde)</p>
<p>In this covid period, school and college-level science fairs are hardly taking place. So, we have built a website where different organizing teams can host their events, and students can participate in a science fair by going through the list and details of different organizations. Also, people who aren't participating can go through the projects and learn.</p>
<br />
<h4>Brief</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Host - One can host a science fair and get a dashboard. In the dashboard, the Host can see the details and submissions of the participants registered to the event that he hosted.</li>
  <li>Participant - A participant can check out the science fair section, where he can find the list of hosted Science fairs. He/She can check the details of the event and can then apply accordingly. </li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>During the offline Science Exhibitions, all the students were allowed to go through the projects irrespective of they are a participant or not! Thus, keeping this in mind, we have a "Projects" section where all the projects submitted by different students for various organizations are lined up. So, one can easily go through the projects and learn.</p>
