<p>Idea: Science Fair management system (Scienocyde)</p>
<p>In this covid period, school and college-level science fairs are hardly taking place.
So, we are planning to build a website where different organizing teams can host their events, and students can participate in a science fair by going through the list and details of different organizations. Also, people who aren't participating can go through the projects and learn.</p>
